# What is Eris Core:

Eris core is a audio focused hardware/software subsystem component intended for further integration into projects & products

# Features:

* No Operating System - No boot, instant on
* Capable of 32bit @ 192khz audio IO
* Low noise linear ganged power supplys
* TFT touch screen interface
* ADIO connector interface for analog inputs, digital inputs & encoder inputs expansion
* Serial connector interface for I2C & SPI expansion
* The ADC's audio front end supports single-ended input levels from small-mV microphone inputs to 2.1-VRMS line inputs
* The ADC's front-end mixer (MIX), multiplexer (MUX), and PGA also support differential (Diff), pseudo-differential, and single-ended (SE) inputs, making these devices an ideal interface for products that require interference suppression.
