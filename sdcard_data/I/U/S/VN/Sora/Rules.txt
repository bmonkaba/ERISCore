RULES
-Credit "Noraneko Games" 
-Credit can be given in the in-game credits, in a note accompanying the game, or on a website where the game is downloaded. Any one of those is fine.
-If you re-upload this to any other site as this asset pack, I require a link back to this page.
-Modifications are allowed. (Change colors, new pose, new hairstyle, change clothes, holding things, add blood splatters, makeup, etc)
-Using for 18+ is fine as long as it doesn't contain illegal themes/content that could reflect poorly on the Noraneko Games name and reputation.
-Commercial use in a game is ok if you just let me know you are using it and can provide proof of credit. If you aren't making money from your Game, you can use without contacting me if you'd prefer.
-Using this asset for Game Jams and Contests is okay!
-If you want to use this media for anything other than a game, leave a comment and I'll let you know if it's okay.
-Not required, but I would love for you to link me to your project!
